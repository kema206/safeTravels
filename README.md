<h2>About Our Website</h2>
Picture having to travel but not being familiar with the place you are traveling to. This is where "Safe Travels" comes.<br>
This website will help you to plan your travels. The concept of this website is to highlight neighbourhoods with different<br>
colours corresponding to their crime rates. Moreover, there are also multiple tags pinpointing the exact location of medical<br>
establishments, amenities, and skytrain stations. These tags could help travelers to determine the location that suits them<br>
the most.

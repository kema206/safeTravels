<h1> Safe Travels (BCHacks 4.0) </h1>
<h3><i>"Where we do the thinking"</i>  -Darren Evan</h3>

<h2>About Our Website</h2>
Picture having to travel but not being familiar with the place you are traveling to. This is where "Safe Travels" comes.<br>
This website will help you to plan your travels by highlighting neighbourhoods with different colours corresponding to their crime rates, so user could be aware of what safety will most likely look like based on past data. Moreover, there are also multiple tags pinpointing the exact location of medical<br>
establishments, amenities, and skytrain stations. These tags could help travelers to determine the location that suits them<br>
the most. 

<h2>How We Calculate the Crime Rate</h2>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
- Include areas outside of Vancouver
- Have a more accurate and consistent border per "neighbourhood"
- Add more features such as bus stops, food places
- Add average prices reviews for accomodations (hotels and AirBnB)

<h2>About Our Website</h2>
Picture having to travel but not being familiar with the place you are traveling to. This is where "Safe Travels" comes.<br>
"Safe Travels" is a website will help our fellow travelers decide where to stay by compiling various statistics about<br>
diferrent neigbouthoods in the area. One of the feature is highlighting neighbourhoods with different colours on their<br>
corresponding crime rates. Additionaly, there are also multiple tags pinpointing the exact location of medical establishments,<br>
amenities, and skytrain stations. These tags could help travelers decide the location that best suits them. By using our website,<br>
travellers would not have to stress out planning everything!

<h2>How We Calculate the Crime Rate</h2>
Our website calculates the crime rate per neighbourhood. The formula that we used is:<br>

This would give us the number of crimes that happen per 1000 people in each neighbourhood.<br> 

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
- Include areas outside of Vancouver<br>
- Have a more accurate and consistent border per "neighbourhood"<br>
- Add more features such as bus stops, food places<br>
- Add reviews and average prices for accomodations (hotels and AirBnB)<br>
- Add travelers' preference on safety, public transport, affordability<br>
- Make the website available online (now it is local host and requires docker)<br>

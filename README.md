<h1> Safe Travels (BCHacks 4.0) </h1>

<h2>About Our Website</h2>
Picture having to travel but not being familiar with the place you are traveling to. This is where "Safe Travels" comes.
This website will help you to plan your travels by highlighting neighbourhoods with different colours corresponding to their crime rates, so user could be aware of what safety will most likely look like based on past data. Moreover, if first respond is something our users are concerned about, our website also provide multiple tags pinpointing the exact location of medical establishments such as hospitals and medical clinics. To make planning even MORE easy, we also provide locations to public transport in the form of skytrains. By using our website, travellers would not have to stress out planning everything!

<h2>How We Calculate the Crime Rate</h2>
Our website calculates the crime rate per neighbourhood, so that the user can determine how safe it would be to stay in that neighbourhood. The formula that we used is to divide the number of crime that has happened divided by the number of people living there times 1000. This would give us the number of crimes that happen per 1000 people

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
- Include areas outside of Vancouver
- Have a more accurate and consistent border per "neighbourhood"
- Add more features such as bus stops, food places
- Add average prices reviews for accomodations (hotels and AirBnB)
- Add users' preference on safety, public transport, affordability

<h2>About Our Website</h2>
Picture having to travel but not being familiar with the place you are traveling to.<br> 
This is where "Safe Travels" comes. This website will help you to plan your travels by<br> 
highlighting neighbourhoods with different colours corresponding to their crime rates,<br> 
so user could be aware of what safety will most likely look like based on past data.<br> 
Moreover, if first respond is something our users are concerned about, our website<br> 
also provide multiple tags pinpointing the exact location of medical establishments<br> 
such as hospitals and medical clinics. To make planning even MORE easy, we also provide<br> 
locations to public transport in the form of skytrains. By using our website, travellers<br> 
would not have to stress out planning everything!

<h2>How We Calculate the Crime Rate</h2>
Our website calculates the crime rate per neighbourhood, so that the user can determine how<br> 
safe it would be to stay in that neighbourhood. The formula that we used is:<br>

This would give us the number of crimes that happen per 1000 people in each neighbourhood.<br> 

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
- Include areas outside of Vancouver<br>
- Have a more accurate and consistent border per "neighbourhood"<br>
- Add more features such as bus stops, food places<br>
- Add reviews and average prices for accomodations (hotels and AirBnB)<br>
- Add travelers' preference on safety, public transport, affordability<br>
- Make the website available online (now it is local host and requires docker)<br>
